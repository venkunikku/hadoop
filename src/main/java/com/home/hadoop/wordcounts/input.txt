Hi Outlet Web Alert Team,
Once upon a time we showed 500 people a picture of a red dress and asked them to describe it. They gave back 129 words for ?red?, 275 descriptions of the belt, 105 of the length, and 216 words to name the occasion where they would wear it.
Imagine putting that manually into your site search. For one item.
There?s a whole world of algorithms, data, and infrastructure that powers the top brands? intuitive site searches. Because intelligent search is the difference between a frustrated customer that give up when her search for ?shirt dress? returns men?s dress shirts and a satisfied customer that sees the most relevant, personally curated dresses at the top of her list.
